    <p>
    Homescapes is a match-3 puzzle game, where the core gameplay is based on swapping two adjacent elements to make a row or column of at least three elements. <br> The player can obtain helpful power-ups and activate them by double-tapping them or switching with another element.
    &nbsp;
    To complete levels, the player must achieve the listed goals in the level (e.g. collect a number of certain elements, lay down carpet, remove suds, etc.).<br> In doing so, the player will earn stars to complete tasks around the house and progress further in the game.
